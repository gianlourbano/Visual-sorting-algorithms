# Sorting Algorithms visulized with Allegro library

Visualize Quicksort and Bubblesort with this program!

---

You can press `A` to shuffle the rectangles, `S` to do a quicksort and `W` to do a bubblesort.
You can clearly see how bubblesort is so uneffective compared to quicksort.
In the command prompt there will be printed the elapsed time to sort the array and the interactions with the rectangles.

### knows issues

While a sort is running, the main windows cannot be closed. To exit the program, close the command prompt.
